# Resources
This project is ported to C# using the BonEngine and SDL2.

## BonEngine
[BonEngine](https://github.com/RonenNess/BonEngine) is a game engine designed to be simple and straightforward, with as little setup as possible.
[BonEngineSharp](https://github.com/RonenNess/BonEngineSharp) is a C# bind of BonEngine. The APIs are nearly identical, so in this doc we'll only cover few examples and not the whole API.
